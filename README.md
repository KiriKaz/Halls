### You hear mechanical whirring.

# What is this?

If you don't know who I am, you won't find anything of interest here, I don't think (yet anyway) - but!
The Halls are going to be where all my writing will reside. They will be hosted on a website, not yet publically available, organized neatly in categories for me to have an easier time writing them, and for you to have an easier time reading them. So far, I've spent my time posting my writings scattered about - vent writings in Twitter (on one of two accounts), Halls writings on the Dishcord, private writings on private servers of mine... no more, I say!

## What are my goals?

I want to have a place for all of my friends to make accounts, read my writing (all neatly organized), be that through Discord webhooks, RSS feeds, or just plain ol' through the website.
I want to have a unique, interesting and engaging way for friends and strangers to interact with my stories - presenting them in a new, extensible and easy-to-write-in format, allowing for creative exploration similar to abstract projects like House of Leaves.

## What technologies am I currently using to accomplish this?

1. ReactJS
2. NextJS
3. NodeJS
4. MUI (formerly Material UI)
5. Prisma ORM
6. PostgreSQL
7. Slate
8. JWT (jsonwebtoken)

## Sounds great! Can I help you make this?

No. At least, as of yet, no. I want to make something wonderful on my own first, and then extend it through my own hands and other individuals who may be interested in helping me develop something bigger than just a place for *my* writing: I am going to leverage Slate to make it so *anyone* can use the custom styling, elements, marks, tags, whatever to write their own creative stories in an intriguing medium.

## When will you be done?

When it's done TM! I'll be chipping away at this over time.

## How can I run this?

As of now, I would recommend you don't. If you seriously want to, though, here's what you'll want to do (assuming that you have NodeJS, and by extension NPM, installed):

1. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and up and running, with a passworded `postgres` user.
2. Clone the project.
3. ...

(Instructions are a WIP.)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
